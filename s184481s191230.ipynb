This document may contain important information such as business reports, academic papers, or personal messages. The text file may be encoded using ASCII, which uses 8 bits per character. This means that each character in the text document can be represented by a sequence of 8 binary digits, or bits. The channel used for transmission is a binary symmetric channel, which means that the transmitted bits can be flipped with a certain probability of error. The probability of error for this channel is 0.02, which means that 2% of the transmitted bits are expected to be flipped during transmission. This can result in errors in the received text, which can lead to misunderstandings or loss of important information. Therefore, it is important to develop techniques to ensure the accurate and reliable transmission of the text document over the noisy communication channel."]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Question 16\n","\n","Implement a function to read the text document and encode the text signal using the binary ASCII fixed-length binary code.
